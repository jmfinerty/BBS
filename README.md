Homework 4, Question 2

Implement the Blum-Blum-Shub algorithm for generating pseudorandom sequences of 0s and 1s (re-member that it requires the input of two specially chosen primes and a seed).

Use the algorithm with p=1000003 and q=2001911.  Select a valid seed x (there are valid seed that are less than 10, pick one of them) and generate a sequence of length 100,000.  

(1) Compute the average number of 0â€™s in asubsequence of length 1000 over all such subsequences.  
(2) Among all subsequences of length 4 (thereare 16 of them) tabulate the frequency of each of them occurring as a subsequence of the sequence you generated.

Submit your program (the source code and brief instructions how to compile and run it).
Submit a brief report with the results and a discussion interpreting them.
