This is an implementation of the Blum Blum Shub algorithm,
a pseudo-random number generation algorithm.

Running 'python3 main.py' will generate a pseudo-random number 
based on parameters defined in the assignment.

It will then analyze and output the frequency of various subsequences
within the generated psuedo-random number.
